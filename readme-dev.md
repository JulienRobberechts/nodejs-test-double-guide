# Dev notes

## focus

- only nodejs = commonJS
- only good practices : no internal mocking demonstration
- no api mock anymore.

## Questions to solve

- when there is interception, it's not a spy anymore it's a mock (at least with Jest)

## in progress



## todo

- create multiple methods to check if all methods are mocked?
- inventory of relative paths: relative from the test to the dependency OR NOT???

- move logic into before-each


- rename moduleA as System under test
- Review all tests
