# Dev notes

## focus

- only nodejs = commonJS
- only good practices : no internal mocking demonstration
- no api mock anymore.

## Questions to solve

- when there is interception, it's not a spy anymore it's a mock (at least with Jest)

## in progress

- Sinon + testdouble

## todo

- Jasmine test
- watch videos about testdouble: https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble
