# Dev notes

## focus

- only nodejs = commonJS
- only good practices : no internal mocking demonstration
- no api mock anymore.

## Questions to solve

- when there is interception, it's not a spy anymore it's a mock (at least with Jest)

## in progress

- test side effect on every test after jest: 
sinon-...



## todo

- move logic into before-each

- rename moduleA as System under test
- Review all tests



- readme: inventory of relative paths: relative from the test to the dependency OR NOT???

- readme: talk about : The AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern is a common way of writing unit tests for a method under test.
- readme: talk about : side effects of each framework.
- readme: multiple way to use sinon: reset vs restore
